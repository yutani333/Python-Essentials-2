# Python-Essentials-2
This is a repository for the exercises, and labs, and other side projects I completed during the course of completing the Edube Interactive Python Essentials 2 online course.
I have included the programs both from the course exercises themselves, as well as programs I wrote alongside them, exploring the topics more, or simply playing with other topics.
